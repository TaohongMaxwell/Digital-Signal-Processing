## Introduction

This repository is aim to help students major in Communication / Information / Electronic / Computer / AI learn and practice the computer method for Digital Signal Processing. It is written purely in MATLAB language.

(Need to improve)

## Why-MATLAB

MATLAB is a high-performance scientific and engineering calculation software developed by MathWorks, USA. It has a wide range of applications in numerical computing, automatic control, signal processing, neural networks, optimization calculations, wavelet analysis, image processing and other fields.

In recent years, the application of MATLAB in domestic universities and research institutes has gradually become popular, and it has become one of the necessary tools for scientific research and engineering technicians. MATLAB has the advantages of convenient matrix and array operation, high programming efficiency, easy to learn and use, strong expandability and good portability. It is commonly known as the “scientific computing language of draft paper”. It frees engineers from cumbersome code and can quickly validate their models and algorithms.

As a high-level language for science and engineering computing, MATLAB is a powerful engineering calculation and data processing software widely used in industrial communication, signal processing, biomedical, control and many other fields. It is an object-oriented, interactive programming language with a well-structured and excellent portability.

The main feature of MATLAB is its powerful matrix computing power and simulation capabilities. Learn the basic operation of the software and its programming methods, experience and gradually master its functions in matrix operations, signal processing and other specific applications. In addition, MATLAB provides a convenient drawing function that allows users to intuitively output processing results.

Through the experiment of this repository, students are required to use MATLAB programming to complete some basic functions of digital signal processing, and deepen the understanding of the content of signal processing theory courses. Gradually develop students' ability to use their knowledge to analyze and solve problems.
