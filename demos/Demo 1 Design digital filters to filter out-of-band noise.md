# Demo 1 Design digital filters to filter out-of-band noise

1. Record a speech signal containing male and female voices, perform time and frequency analysis on the speech signal, and obtain observation and analysis conclusions;
2. The speech signal is subjected to two different frequencies of noise audio interference, one is less than 50 Hz or greater than 3500 Hz; the other noise is in the frequency range of 50 to 3500 Hz. The noise can be a single frequency, but it is better to have a certain bandwidth and have extra points for bandwidth. Draw the time domain waveform and spectrum after noise addition;
3. Design a suitable filter, filter the above two kinds of noise, and compare the filtering effect to analyze the reason;
4. Write the design report and complete the simulation, and conduct the acceptance and defense.
